  <h1>Mission</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the tracking website for the St. John's Streets Project. In November 2019 after seeing a post by Reddit user /u/davisvilums I was inspired to attempt a similar project in my home town. I currently track my rides using the Strava Android application. I then export the .GPX files from the Strava webpage and combine them using a free program - GPS Babble. An online tool GPS visulaizer is used to map all the GPX line simultaniously allowing me to keep track of what streets I have completed. </p>
  <h1> Future Plans </h1>

    <li> Keep riding as much as I can. With the waether begining to improve this has become significantly easier </li>
    <li> Create my own Leaflet-based GPX visualizing code. This will allow furter customizations including adding a live location display. It is also a personaly goal to become more familiar with web mapping tools</li>
    <li> Create a script to automatically download Strava .GPX files</li>
    <li> Add Eric Prince's Derive visualization to the Webpage</li>
